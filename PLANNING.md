# PLANNING

The objective for the system is to allow users to display a range of stocks and write them to file. Users can keep updating the file to contain numerous stock ranges. This file can be sorted to analyze stocks from different companies over the same period of time.

# INFORMATION INPUTS AND OUTPUTS

Upon opening the application, users will be asked to enter a stock symbol (i.e. information input). After entering a stock symbol, users will be prompted to pick a command: 'display' or 'add'. If users choose the 'display' command, a range of stocks will be displayed. If users choose the 'add' command, a .csv file will be created that includes the range (i.e. information output). Users can further repeat this process to add to the .csv file.

Note: a .csv file can be created prior to opening that app that includes the appropriate column headers contained in README.md. These headers will not otherwise appear in the file.
